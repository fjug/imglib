// NOTE : convolution and correlation are similar operations whose output is
//   rotated by 180 degrees for the same kernel. You can get one or the other
//   from the same function by rotating the input kernel by 180 degrees. As
//   implemented below this function is really a Correlation.

// TODO
//   A convolution is really a GeneralBinaryOperation between an input function
//   and a kernel function. For efficiency this class exists. For generality a
//   kernel function could calculate in evaluate(neigh,point,output) the relation
//   of neigh and point and choose the correct index into the kernel. By doing
//   this we could have more flexibility in the definitions of kernels (rather
//   than just an array of user supplied reals).
